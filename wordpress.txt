Introduction : Wordpress is considered to be the most popular CMS (content management system) on the internet which allows us to set up blogs and websites with 
               the ease of a few clicks.As it has an engaing UI, modifying it to our convenience is easier thus making it a robust application. 
                
               The objective behind this guide will be to set up a Highly Available, Scalable and Failure Resistent Wordpress Application Architecture that involves 
               Virtual Private Cloud(VPC), Application Load Balancer (ALB) , DNS Name, Auto Scaling Group ( ASG), Relational Database Service (RDS),EC2 instances 
               and a CI/CD Pipeline.
               
               
VPC: AWS provides us with a platform of making our own private cloud for security and safety reasons. For maintaining data abstraction and securing data
     we configure a VPC which by default makes a ROute Table, Security Group and an Access Control List (ACL).Navigate to the VPC dashbaord and proceed as follows: 
     
     - Create a new VPC by providing name and an IPv4 CIDR Block to VPC created in a region.
     - Creating subnets in configured VPC in different Availability Zones having IPv4 CIDR out of the VPC CIDR range ( Preferably 2 subnets per AZ ) 
     - Create and Internet Gateway and attach it to the configured VPC.
     - Allow 1 Subnet in each AZ to modify auto-assign IP settings in actions of subnet to enable auto-assign public IPv4 address which will act as our public subnet.
     - The default Route Table has no subnet association. Create a new route table and associate the public subnet to it and add 0.0.0.0 and ::/0 in destination and igw in target.
